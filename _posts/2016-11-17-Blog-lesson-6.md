  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had a virtual shop with several working formulae.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve my virtual shop even more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, as I managed to add tax to my items in my shop.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by being able to apply EVEN MORE formulae into my virtual shop to add a certain percentage on my stock when someone purchases it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that i put an overly expensive amount of tax on my items by accident of 175% when I meant to put 17.5% as that is roughly the charge of VAT these days. However i managed to overcome this by realising my mistake and undoing the wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will be extra careful when entering certain figures with decimal places because it can make a big difference in price.  </td>
