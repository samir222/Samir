  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by watching my teacher perform a demonstration about how he managed to add workers to his shop add give them a wage. I took several notes on this so i could repeat these steps on my virtual shop as well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was being able to put a wage that adds up so instead I just put an overall wage per year.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i should try to achieve my target of setting them a wage that adds up more by taking more detailed notes and trying harder and if worse comes to worst, ask a teacher for help.</td>
