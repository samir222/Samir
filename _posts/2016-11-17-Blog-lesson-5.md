  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to use several formulae in my excel virtual shop. I did this by watching a demonstration led at the front of the classroom by my IT teacher who made it really simple and easy to understand.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that once again I kept adding in unnecessary characters by accident as all these formulae that I was using had a lot of random letters and number and stuff in brackets. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will 100% write down the whole formula of each formula i use so i write it down in excel perfectly .</td>
